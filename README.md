# Easy Proxy. How bypass your company security!

If you have a VPS you can use it, if not, you can buy one in the market for less than 2eur / month

On remote server (VPS):
1 - Disable apache
2 - Disable iptables
3 - Configure sshd to port 80 (I believe that your company allow port 80)

On local machine:
1 - Use my scripts to call X server and use all aplications
