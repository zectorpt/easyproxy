# Easy Proxy. How bypass your company security!

If you have a VPS you can use it, if not, you can buy one in the market for less than 2eur / month <br><br>

On remote server (VPS):<br>
1 - Disable apache<br>
2 - Disable iptables<br>
3 - Configure sshd to port 80 (I believe that your company allow port 80)<br><br>

On local machine:<br>
1 - Use my scripts to call X server and use all aplications<br>
